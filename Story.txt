Welcome to Cardinal.
To begin your adventure you must choose your weapon.
You have a choice between a bow, sword, spear and shield?
What weapon would you like?

You walk inside the cave and it's pitch black. You have no idea what's around you.
Then you strike up a torch and bats suddenly swarm past you.
You gasp for breath and continue to walk further down the cave as the only thing keeping you grounded is your source of light
5 minutes pass by and you see some light further in front of you.
As you walk towards it, you see a large pit of lava. You walk towards the pit, looking for a way across.
You hear multiple growls and barking behind you. As you turn around...
A human-sized three-headed hound with sharp claws stands in front you, eyeing its prey.

It's a breezy day. You absorb the greenery around with your eyes.
Even though the forest looks peaceful, you keep your guard up for anything that tries to attack you.
In the distance, you see a horde of red balloon monsters in one spot.
One balloon monster strays away from the horde and you follow it as an opportunity to kill it.
It notices you following it, and you get ready to fight.

You will now enter the mountains.
You tread carefully through each rocky gap as you ascend.
The air starts to thin out and you start to breath heavily.
After 10 minutes of hiking up the mountains, you come across a huge, spacious platform with jagged rocks surround it.
You hear a large roar, you look up and see a creature land from the sky.

You stumble upon a village. Seeking shelter from the rain that suddenly poured.
As you walk into a door, you get pulled into a different reality.
It does have a resemblance to the world you're used to, but it is much darker.
As you blink, different images emerge.
On every third blink of yours, a cloaked figure approaches closer and closer.
You notice this trend, which gives you time to draw your weapon and fight.
